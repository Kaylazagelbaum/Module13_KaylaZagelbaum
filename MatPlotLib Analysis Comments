1) Average highs:
My graph shows the average high temperatures for each month in Flatbush.
I noticed that during the summer months the temperature are higher.
I was surprised by just how low the average highs were in January. I know the winter is cold but I didn't think it was THAT cold.

2) Extreme highs:
My graph shows the highest high temperatures for each month in Flatbush.
I noticed that the biggest differences between the average highs and extreme highs were during the transitional months, like the beginning of Fall or end of Spring.
I was shocked that temperature reached the hundreds in September.

3) Highs and lows:
My graph shows 2 lines; one is the highest temperatures of each month and the other is the lowest temperatures of each month.
I noticed that the graphs follow the same general shape, with the exception of a few outliers.
I was surprised that the graph of the highest temperatures had so much more variation than the graph of the lowest temperatures.

4) Precipitation
My graph shows the snowfall in inches by month.
I noticed that there was significantly more snowfall in January and February.
I was surprised that it snows so much in April.
